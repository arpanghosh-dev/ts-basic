**Understanding the `replace` Prop in `<Navigate />` (React Router)**

---

### What does `replace` do in `<Navigate />`?

When using:

```jsx
<Navigate to="/login" replace />
```

The `replace` prop tells **React Router** to **replace the current entry** in the browser's **history stack** with the new location (`/login`).

### Why is this useful?

Using `replace` is helpful when you want to:

* Prevent users from returning to the previous page using the **Back** button.
* Handle redirects after **login/logout**.
* Navigate away from a protected or obsolete route.

### Without `replace`

```jsx
<Navigate to="/login" />
```

This **adds a new entry** to the history stack. Pressing the **Back** button will return the user to the previous page.

### Example:

| Action                | With `replace`          | Without `replace`       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- |
| User visits `/`       | `/`                     | `/`                     |
| Redirects to `/login` | `/login` (replaces `/`) | `/login` (added on top) |
| Press Back button     | Can't go back to `/`    | Goes back to `/`        |

### Summary

* `<Navigate to="/login" replace />`
  ➜ Replaces current page in browser history → **Back button is disabled** for the previous route.

* `<Navigate to="/login" />`
  ➜ Adds a new page in browser history → **Back button works** as usual.

### Use `replace` when:

* Redirecting after login or logout.
* Routing away from a page the user should not revisit.
